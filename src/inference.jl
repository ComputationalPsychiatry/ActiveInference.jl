##PTW_CR: I would perhgaps call this 'update prediction'
""" Get Expected States """
##PTW_CR: Remember to type the functions
function get_expected_states(qs, B, policy)
    ##PTW_CR: Again, have these stored in the struct to avoid having to recreate them on every timestep
    n_steps, n_factors = size(policy)

    ##PTW_CR: There must most certainly be a way of avoiding a list comprehension of deepcopies here
    # initializing posterior predictive density as a list of beliefs over time
    qs_pi = [deepcopy(qs) for _ in 1:n_steps+1]

    ##PTW_CR: Wait: an important distinction: 
    ##PTW_CR: There is calculating the prediction at the current timesetp, given my previous action and beliefs
    ##PTW_CR: There is also calculating the expected states at the next n timesteps given my current beliefs and a policy
    ##PTW_CR: Which one is this? Put it under action!() if it is the latter
  
    ##PTW_CR: I am expecting it is the latter: this is predicting the hypothetical future given a policy

    ##PTW_CR: This wil be one of the computationally heavy parts of the model, so we want to optimize it as much as possible
    ##PTW_CR: Check it: but I think initializing a new matrix is faster than the deepcopy
    ##PTW_CR: But even faster would be to already have the right size matrix, and just overwrite it every time
    ##PTW_CR: (this avoids allocating memory all the time)
    ##PTW_CR: Can that be done? Haing the full structure (outside of this function) and just overwriting its values? 
    ##PTW_CR: I'll return to this at the place where this is run
    ##PTW_CR: But in summary, I think it might be nice to have a function which gets the expected states for all timesteps for all policies.. 
    ##PTW_CR: that shouldn't become such a high number that its too mcuh to hold in memory I think

    ##PTW_CR: I guess there are no interactions between control Factors
    ##PTW_CR: (btw: we need a third word: observation modality, state factor, and control something?)
    ##PTW_CR: (Weird to use factor for just two of them I think)
    ##PTW_CR: (It's all just different words for dimensionality)


    # expected states over time
    for t in 1:n_steps
        for control_factor in 1:n_factors
            action = policy[t, control_factor]

""" Update Posterior States """
##PTW_CR: it should be posterior_states - but state_posterior (it is a posterior over states, not posterior states)
##PTW_CR: so update_posterior() or update_state_posterior()

    num_obs, num_states, num_modalities, num_factors = get_model_dimensions(A)

    ##PTW_CR: same here
    obs_processed = process_observation(obs, num_modalities, num_obs)

    ##PTW_CR: Probably there's no need to have this as a separate function
    ##PTW_CR: Although: You might make a multiple dispatch, where there are different version of update_posterior for different types of optimization schemes
    ##PTW_CR: And make types for each, with FixedPointIteration being one of them

    ##PTW_CR: Is it because the fixed point is analytically calculateable in that case?

        ##PTW_CR: call num_iter max_iterations
        ##PTW_CR: I think perhaps there should be a struct somewhere (saved in the larger struct) which has the settings for the fixed-point updates
        ##PTW_CR: And this function should multiple dispatch on that type
