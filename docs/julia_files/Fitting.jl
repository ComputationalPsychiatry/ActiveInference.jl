# # Model Fitting 

# In many cases, we want to draw conclusions about specific observed phenomena, such as behavioural differences between distinct populations. A conventional approach in this context is model fitting, which involves estimating the parameter values (e.g., prior beliefs) of an AIF model that are most likely given the observed behaviour of a participant. In fields such as computational psychiatry or mathematical psychology, this approach is often used to develop more precise models and theories of mental processes, to find mechanistic differences between clinical populations, or to investigate the relationship between computational constructs such as Bayesian beliefs and neuronal dynamics.
