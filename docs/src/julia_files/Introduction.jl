# # Introduction to the ActiveInference.jl package

# This package is a Julia implementation of the Active Inference framework, with a specific focus on cognitive modelling.
# In its current implementation, the package is designed to handle scenarios that can be modelled as discrete state spaces, with 'partially observable Markov decision process' (POMDP).
# In this documentation we will go through the basic concepts of how to use the package for different purposes; simulation and model inversion with Active Inference, also known as parameter estimation.
