# # Creating the Generative Model

# In this section we will go through the process of creating a generative model and how it should be structured.

# ## The Generative Model Conceptually

# The generative model is the parameters that constitute the agent's beliefs on how the hidden states of the environment generates observations based on states, and how hidden underlying states changes over time.
# In the generative model is also the beliefs of how the agent through actions can influence the states of the environment. Together this holds the buidling blocks that allows for the perception-action loop.

# There are five main buidling blocks of the generative model
